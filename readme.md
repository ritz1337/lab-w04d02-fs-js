# Parse CSV, Create JSON, and Profit!

Our boss is stuck in the Stone Age as has handed us a CSV containing some Census data. As web developers, we're much happier having our data stored as JSON because it's easy to parse and zip up as a string in case we have to send it somewhere else. Our first job is to use our knowledge of file IO to create a well-structured, JSON version of that census data.

Use the `census_data.csv` file and Node's filesystem module to turn that data into a valid and usable JSON file.
